/* naming conventions are fun */

Here was supposed to be the template projects page that would open when you click on a project button of the main portfolio.
Most of my time was spent fixing errors on the main page, so i didnt end up spending as much time on this page(s). 

I'll most likely include the rough wrireframe I drew, but it was supposed to be a simple page that shown off the different projects 
Ive indulged in, starting with the highlight project (which contains the most pictures/ process details) followed by other projects 
in the same theme (less pics and details, but show the similarities).
